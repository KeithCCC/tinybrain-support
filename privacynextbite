Privacy Policy – Nextbite

Last updated: 23 Nov 2025

Nextbite (“we”, “our”, “the App”) is a fasting timer and history tracker. We respect your privacy and keep data handling minimal.

Information We Collect

We do not create accounts or upload personal data to our servers.
All fasting entries and settings stay on your device’s local storage (AsyncStorage). If you uninstall the app, that data is removed.
Ads & Analytics

The App shows banner ads via Google AdMob. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage information to deliver and measure ads. You can review Google’s policies here: https://policies.google.com/privacy.
We request user consent where required by law and allow non-personalized ads if consent is declined.
App Permissions

The App only accesses basic device capabilities required to run (local storage, network to load ads). We do not request optional permissions (camera, contacts, etc.).
Children

The App is not directed at children under 13 and does not intentionally collect data from them.
Data Sharing

We do not sell or share personal information with third parties. AdMob receives ad-request data as described above.
Security

Local data stays on your device. We rely on the security features provided by your operating system and Google Play for distribution.
Your Choices

You may reset consent for ads via Android’s ads settings or reinstall the app.
To delete local data, uninstall the app. There is no server data to delete.

If you have privacy questions, email us at [your support email].
