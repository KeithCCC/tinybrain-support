  <h1>Privacy Policy – Nextbite</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 23 Nov 2025</p>

  <p>Nextbite (“we”, “our”, “the App”) is a fasting timer and history tracker. We respect your privacy and keep data handling minimal.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not create accounts or upload personal data to our servers. All fasting entries and settings stay on your device’s local storage. Removing the app deletes this information.</p>

  <h2>Ads &amp; Analytics</h2>
  <p>The App shows banner ads via Google AdMob, which may collect device identifiers and usage data to deliver and measure ads. You can review Google’s policies at
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.
    We request consent where required and honor non-personalized ads if consent is declined.</p>

  <h2>App Permissions</h2>
  <p>The App only needs basic network access to load ads and uses local storage for your fasting history. We do not request optional permissions like camera or contacts.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from them.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or share personal information. AdMob receives ad request data solely to serve ads in the App.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>All data remains on your device. We rely on the security provided by your operating system and Google Play for distribution.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You may reset advertising consent through Android’s ads settings or by reinstalling the App. To delete local data, uninstall the App—there is no server data to erase.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have privacy questions, email us at <a href="mailto:support@nextbite.app">support@nextbite.app</a>.</p>
